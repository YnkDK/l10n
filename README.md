# Localization
> In computing, internationalization and localization are means of adapting computer software to different 
> languages, regional peculiarities and technical requirements of a target locale. Internationalization 
> is the process of designing a software application so that it can be adapted to various languages and 
> regions without engineering changes. Localization is the process of adapting internationalized software
>  for a specific region or language by translating text and adding locale-specific components. 
> Localization (which is potentially performed multiple times, for different locales) uses the 
> infrastructure or flexibility provided by internationalization (which is ideally performed only once, 
> or as an integral part of ongoing development)
